{"name":"Analysis of State-wise Infant Mortality Rate","tagline":"","body":"### Introduction\r\nThe infant mortality rate(deaths/1,000 live births) correlates very strongly with, and is among the best predictors of, state failure. IMR is therefore also a useful indicator of a country's level of health or development, and is a component of the physical quality of life index.\r\n\r\nInfant mortality rate (IMR) is not only a group of statistic but instead it is a reflection of the socioeconomic development and effectively represents the presence of medical services in the countries. IMR is an effective resource for the health department to make decision on medical resources reallocation. IMR also formulates the global health strategies and help evaluate the program success. The existence of IMR helps solve the inadequacies of the other vital statistic systems for global health as most of the vital statistic systems usually neglect the infant mortality statistic number from the poor. There are certain amounts of unrecorded infant deaths in the rural area as they do not have information about infant mortality rate statistic or do not have the concept about reporting early infant death.\r\n\r\n###Analysis\r\n\r\nWe try to analyse the percentage Infant Morality Rate in States and Union Territory of India.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project is maintained by @nehiljain and @priyankt68.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
